# TaskCart â€” Full Project Implementation

## Overview

TaskCart is a single-page web application built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without any external frameworks. It combines three core modules:

1. **Portfolio** â€” Showcase your professional skills and projects.
2. **To-Do / Notes Manager** â€” Organize tasks and notes with localStorage persistence.
3. **Product Listing** â€” Interactive product catalog with filtering, sorting, and price sliders.

The app is **responsive**, **accessible**, and optimized for performance.
